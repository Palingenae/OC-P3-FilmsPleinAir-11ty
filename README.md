## About this
This is a school project about a fictive film festival that would happen in Paris, during the end of summer.
The pre-requisite of this project is to demonstrate the ability for one to be part of a project as a Freelance Developer and publish the website as such.

There are other things that the school is asking from their attendees, but it won't be published in this repository.
